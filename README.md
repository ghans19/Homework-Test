# Homework-Test
This is an article I wrote after interviewing Maragret Cho, reuploaded as a practise on Github. (Link: http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Arts_and_Theatre/2017-08-19/interview_margaret_cho.html) 

"I’m excited about the show. It’s savage, it’s nasty, it’s great."

Margaret Cho has become known for her dark sense of humour. Now 48, the Drop Dead Diva star has embarked on a tour with what she has described as her "sickest show to date", with it dealing with "a lot of hard stuff about addiction, about weight."

Cho notes she can be "very, very self-destructive" before adding: "I really wanted to make an effort to show how this is like so scary and this is real and this can happen. And so, that’s a big part of the show too."

She cites the late Richard Pryor as an inspiration for helping her to develop this style of comedy: "what is really vital and exciting about comedy is that you can ride that edge of 'this is too much, like, this is wrong' and I learnt all about this from Richard Pryor, who was a great hero of mine. I was able to know him briefly at the end of his life and I’m close with his daughter, Rayne. So, you know, I just love his stuff - he talks about addiction brilliantly and so that’s what I wanted to get into."  

The late Joan Rivers has also had an important influence on her career. "Joan Rivers was my friend, my champion, mentor, somebody that I looked up to tremendously," Cho tells me. "I want to embody both of them. Try to be like both of them. That’s my ultimate goal." 

The show will feature a lot about Donald Trump; it's "kind of a global apology tour," she explains. She also deals with her runs in with Jennifer Saunders and Tilda Swinton over the casting of non-Asian actors in Asian roles: "I just think it isn’t wrong to have Asian actors in Asian roles. I don’t know how or why that is a controversial thought. There’s so much lee-way white people give themselves in terms of racism. Like, they have such a huge sort of grace period in issues, where they think, “ok racism is acceptable in these contexts." And it’s not. So, you know, it’s important to point it out. I love pointing it out and I love revelling in it and being nasty about being right. So it’s petty, it’s funny, and I love it."

Cho, whose tour comes to Britain in late November, is looking forward to spending time in Britain: "I always do and this time I get to go to places like Sheffield and Birmingham and places I haven’t been, I love it. I’m really excited about that, to go to new places and also go back to London and Edinburgh."

Her previous tour featured dog rescuing, where before the show the audience could see dogs that they could apply to adopt. This feature won't return, however, as Cho explains it was "hard to get together but it was very successful." She did, however, note the experience was "really cute" and it was "really nice to have that" as part of the show.
