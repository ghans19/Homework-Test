# Homework-Test
This is an article I wrote after interviewing Maragret Cho, reuploaded as a practise on Github. (Link: http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Arts_and_Theatre/2017-08-19/interview_margaret_cho.html) 

"I’m excited about the show. It’s savage, it’s nasty, it’s great."

Margaret Cho has become known for her dark sense of humour. Now 48, the Drop Dead Diva star has embarked on a tour with what she has described as her "sickest show to date", with it dealing with "a lot of hard stuff about addiction, about weight."

Cho notes she can be "very, very self-destructive" before adding: "I really wanted to make an effort to show how this is like so scary and this is real and this can happen. And so, that’s a big part of the show too."

She cites the late Richard Pryor as an inspiration for helping her to develop this style of comedy: "what is really vital and exciting about comedy is that you can ride that edge of 'this is too much, like, this is wrong' and I learnt all about this from Richard Pryor, who was a great hero of mine. I was able to know him briefly at the end of his life and I’m close with his daughter, Rayne. So, you know, I just love his stuff - he talks about addiction brilliantly and so that’s what I wanted to get into."  

The late Joan Rivers has also had an important influence on her career. "Joan Rivers was my friend, my champion, mentor, somebody that I looked up to tremendously," Cho tells me. "I want to embody both of them. Try to be like both of them. That’s my ultimate goal." 

The show will feature a lot about Donald Trump; it's "kind of a global apology tour," she explains. She also deals with her runs in with Jennifer Saunders and Tilda Swinton over the casting of non-Asian actors in Asian roles: "I just think it isn’t wrong to have Asian actors in Asian roles. I don’t know how or why that is a controversial thought. There’s so much lee-way white people give themselves in terms of racism. Like, they have such a huge sort of grace period in issues, where they think, “ok racism is acceptable in these contexts." And it’s not. So, you know, it’s important to point it out. I love pointing it out and I love revelling in it and being nasty about being right. So it’s petty, it’s funny, and I love it."

Cho, whose tour comes to Britain in late November, is looking forward to spending time in Britain: "I always do and this time I get to go to places like Sheffield and Birmingham and places I haven’t been, I love it. I’m really excited about that, to go to new places and also go back to London and Edinburgh."

Her previous tour featured dog rescuing, where before the show the audience could see dogs that they could apply to adopt. This feature won't return, however, as Cho explains it was "hard to get together but it was very successful." She did, however, note the experience was "really cute" and it was "really nice to have that" as part of the show.

Cho will also return to the silver screen with Highland, which has just been picked up by TNT. "It’s a show about the big marijuana boom in California, which is what we’re experiencing right now, this green rush. And this family, this Korean family, that gets very very wealthy, very quickly. And it’s really what’s happening right now, so they’re like the Karhashians."

"I play a recovering drug addict, who has to work in the middle of this and not get high. It’s like a minefield, so I’m loving it. It’s really cool."

In 1994, starring in All American Girl had proved difficult for Cho, who starved herself for weeks after being told to lose weight, causing kidney failure. She was also told at points she was too Asian. However, she notes there have been massive changes in TV since: "We’ve had a real shift since then in the way we look at race in entertainment. Back then, we had a very different system of television; we had four networks and there was no real cable as there is now, so it was very different. If you were on TV the visibility was so high, and there was this attitude we have to alter to conform to the same body type and same look and I was so different in every way. So, I had a lot of problems there."

Cho has persevered and has been named by Rolling Stone as one of 50 best comedians of all time. Fellow actor John Cho (Harold and Kumar) has described his namesake as his "hero." She is clearly delighted at this recognition: "It’s really amazing. And I love John, he’s like my kid. They’re so many things that have happened that I’m amazed about, the thrills and the Rolling Stone thing is so awesome and really exciting and I am in great company there. There with all my friends, so I love that, and I love John, so that’s really cool."

One of the most common features of these acclaimed shows is her high accented impression of her mother, which Cho insists her mother loves, telling me: "You know, I believe that when women age in general, they become invisible. But with my mother, it’s the opposite; she’s become more present in everything that I do."
